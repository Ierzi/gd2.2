# GD-Roulette

A Geometry Dash Level Roulette.

## Features

- Normal List (regular levels ranging from Easy to Extreme Demon)
- Demon List
- Challenge List
- Skip levels you can't beat
- Auto pause after reaching the goal percentage (can be disabled)

## How To Play

Simply choose the list you want to play levels from (the default is normal list), select a difficulty, and press Start!
A random level of the chosen difficulty will be given to you and you will need to achieve a certain percentage in said level (starts from 1%, and increments by 1 after each level beaten).
Normally, you're supposed to get to get the goal percentage, and not higher. Unfortunately, some levels don't have a way to die at said percentage, so the goal will automatically be your death percentage + 1.

After reaching/surpassing the goal percentage in a round of roulette, the game will automatically pause after you die. This can be disabled in the mod's Geode settings.

If a level is too hard, you can click on the Skip button, which will subtract 1 skip from your skips. You can set the number of skips you are allowed to use during a round of roulette in the roulette's settings (accessible from the info icon in the roulette while not playing it, or from the Geode mod settings).

And that's pretty much it! Have fun rouletting!
